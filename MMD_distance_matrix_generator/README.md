# MMD distance matrix generator

##Introduction
We generate a distance matrix using MMD as the distnace metric for two datasets. For each WSI we use an 1024-dimensional feature representation by extracting
the latent representation of the second-last fully connected layer of an ImageNet pretrained SuffleNet. These features were generated for both TP53 gene point mutation prediciton ()
